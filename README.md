## ðŸ”Ž Fancy seeing someone new round here...

Hi there, I'm Detective!

I am a queer writer and game developer based out of San Marcos, Texas. Currently, I am in university for computer science with additional studies in creative writing and Japanese. I am studying C++ and have previously learned Python, Java, and JavaScript. My game engine of choice is Godot. Other hobbies of mine are drawing, baking, and playing video games.

My all-time favorite games are the Hollow Knight and Persona series.

â˜† Thanks for taking the time to stop by! â˜†
